        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> In this recipe we're taking it even further with a Middle-Eastern inspired cumin cinnamon rub.<br> We love these flavors in our Slow Cooker Chicken Rice Casserole recipe, and they work beautifully with the apricot glaze.</p>
        <p> If you want to take full advantage of the flavor that the cumin cinnamon rub can provide, as soon as you get home from the <br> market with your chicken, take it out of its wrapping and coat it all over with the rub. <br>Then return it to your fridge until an hour or two before you are ready to cook it. </p>
